<h5>Food_Delivery_WebApp:</h5>

As the name suggest we are trying to build a food delivery webapp using reactjs.

This project should consists of these pages:
1=>Register page for new users
2=>Login page for the existing ones.
3=>The home page (This page is to be made the most attractive and user friendly in a single scrollable page).
<img src="assest\home.fig" width="400" height="360">
    > If we select an item it should list all the resturant selling this item and their price.
<img src="assest\home_2.fig" width="400" height="360">
    > If the user select any resturant the it should give the menu of that resturant with the specific tags(Staters,main course,deserts etc).
4=>The cart page (This page mainly consists of items that the user selected for order).

The students of ITER-SOAU are highly encouraged to contribute.

Anyone can raise issues and get assigned with the same by the mentors.
